## Preamble
```
MIP4c2-SP#: 6
MIP to be amended: MIP3

Status: Formal Submission (FS)
Date of Amendment Submission: 2020-10-05
Date of ratification: <yyyy-mm-dd>
```
## Specification
    
### Motivation
Although Maker is intended to be a global protocol, in its current state the majority of the active members of governance are located in the United States or Europe. Both these regions have winter holidays that would clash with the conclusion of a monthly governance cycle in December. It is hoped that this exception can be removed in the future when governance of the protocol is more globally distributed.

This change is an addition and makes no modification to the current contents of MIP3 beyond preventing a monthly governance cycle in December, due to this, I feel that it is valid for an amendment and not a replacement of MIP3.

This change has no impact on other MIPs that interact with MIP3, with the exception of preventing new MIPs or subproposals from moving into Formal Submission in December.

### Amended Components
   - MIP3c4 has been added to MIP3. There are no other changes. 
   - MIP3c4 states that there will be no monthly governance cycle in the month of December.

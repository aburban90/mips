## Specification

### Introduction

Net asset value (NAV) issuance allows Set users to issue Sets based on the prices of the component tokens within a Set. To enable NAV issuance for a wider variety of Set compositions, we are requesting access to additional Maker oracles.

### Oracle Name
ZRX/USD

### Customer(s)

Alex Soong - [alex@setprotocol.com](mailto:alex@setprotocol.com)

### Whitelist

### Requirements

For each customer address to be whitelisted:

* Is Oracle data written to storage? no
* If Oracle data is stored, is it stored in a private variable? n/a
* If Oracle data is stored, is the value accessible on-chain exclusively by the protocol? n/a

### Fee

In accordance with the Responsible Oracle Migration Proposal, fees are waived for the first year and determined by MKR Governance after that.

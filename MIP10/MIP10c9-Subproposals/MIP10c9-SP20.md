## Specification

### Introduction

The Gnosis Maker DAO Adapter smart contract allows users to create prediction markets for token prices using Gnosis' Conditional Tokens framework. Users create a market by specifying an oracle, a target value, resolution time and variation range. Market payouts can be binary or scalar. Once the market is created users can create short or long positions using the Gnosis Conditional Tokens contract. When the resolution time is reached the market creator calls a function that queries the Maker oracle and resolves the market. Users may then redeem their positions.
